## Full Description

### Firefox Add-ons / Chrome Web Store

Control any HTML5 video's speed and volume with intuitive gesture controls. No clunky menus, no popups — just a minimal overlay that appears when you hover over a video.

**How it works:**
- **Hover** over any video to reveal the speed controller
- **Scroll** the mouse wheel for precise speed adjustments (0.1x steps)
- **Drag horizontally** to change speed with momentum — the further you drag, the faster it changes
- **Drag vertically** to adjust volume the same way
- **Click** to instantly reset to 1.0x
- **Double-click** to reset to 1.0x

**Features:**
- Works on every website with HTML5 video (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Netflix, and more)
- Adaptive color — the glow matches the video content behind it
- Momentum-based drag with multiple speed tiers
- Ring indicator with directional hint icons (speed/volume)
- Animated tooltip cycles through available shortcuts
- Zero configuration — install and go
- Minimal footprint — no background processes, no data collection
- Transparent and non-intrusive — only visible on hover

**Speed range:** 0.1x to 4.0x
**Volume range:** 0% to 100%

Perfect for lectures, tutorials, podcasts, and binge-watching.
